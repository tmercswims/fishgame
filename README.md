# Fish Game

This is a custom script for the [Streamlabs Chatbot](https://streamlabs.com/chatbot) which plays the meta-minigame in chat for the Jak and Daxter fishing minigame in Forbidden Jungle.

Get it from the [releases page](https://github.com/tmercswims/fishgame/releases). If you are upgrading, do not copy over `vip.txt`.

Made for [OutrageousJosh](https://www.twitch.tv/outrageousjosh), but available for anyone who wants it.
